# Catfolio — Local-first Portfolio, Quant, and Strategy Dashboard

## About this fork

This is a fork of [irrwood/catfolio](https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio). Thanks to [irrwood](https://github.com/irrwood) for building Catfolio and releasing it under the MIT License. The fork adds three things:

- **Longbridge account sync**: connect a Longbridge OpenAPI app in Settings → Accounts to sync holdings and cash read-only. The SDK is an optional install; see [docs/web-account-sync.md](docs/web-account-sync.md#longbridge).
  - Upstream PR: pending
- **Call tracker workspace** (`/calls`): import dated stock calls from any source (a blogger, a newsletter, an analyst note or your own journal) and score them against the prices that followed, 5, 21 and 63 trading days out, with SPY as the benchmark. Each source gets a hit rate, a follow-every-call curve and a monthly hit rate. Details in [Call Tracker](#call-tracker).
  - Upstream PR: pending
- **Small fixes**: Moomoo's Hong Kong symbols are zero-padded to the four-digit form Yahoo accepts (`HK.00700` → `0700.HK`), HKD is added to the Lab and CSV import FX tables, and dead links to the missing `/sentiment` and price-target-history pages are removed.
  - Upstream PRs: pending (HK symbols and HKD FX), pending (dead links)

Both screenshots use demo mode, so the sources, calls and prices are fictional. To try the additions, clone this fork (`https://github.com/jackieyangjq/catfolio.git`) instead of the upstream repository used in the Quick Start below.

Everything else is upstream Catfolio; see the original README below.

Catfolio is a self-hosted portfolio dashboard and quantitative research workspace for investors who want a private command center for holdings, returns, risk, strategy experiments, and AI-assisted analysis.

It runs locally as a web app, can be packaged as a macOS desktop app, and ships with a full demo mode so contributors can explore the product without a broker account or API keys.

The project combines portfolio accounting with quant-style research tools: factor exposure, benchmark comparison, Monte Carlo simulation, efficient-frontier optimization, historical return modeling, and saved Python strategy backtests.

Project repository: [github.com/irrwood/catfolio](https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio)

## Highlights

- **Local-first by default**: portfolio files, imported CSVs, caches, saved strategy runs, and API keys stay on your machine.
- **Demo-safe for open source**: `CATFOLIO_DEMO=1` uses bundled sample data and does not read local private account files.
- **Broker sync or CSV import**: connect Trading 212 for live holdings, or upload broker transaction CSVs to calculate weighted-average cost and current positions.
- **Portfolio overview**: total value, P&L, breadth, concentration, sector exposure, and the largest positions at a glance.
- **Detailed holdings**: full position detail with cost basis, quote currency, market value, P&L, account, and raw-versus-ETF-look-through views.
- **Returns workspace**: portfolio returns against benchmarks such as SPY, QQQ, and IWM, with monthly heatmaps.
- **Analysis charts**: monthly return heatmaps, drawdown curves, holding correlations, valuation matrices, and return distributions.
- **Strategy Lab**: write Python allocation strategies, rebalance over historical prices, compare CAGR/volatility/Sharpe/max drawdown, save runs, and optionally ask an AI provider to critique the result.
- **AI analysis**: portfolio briefing, risk diagnosis, performance explanation, overlap analysis, what-if scenarios, returns explanation, and free-form portfolio Q&A.
- **Local-first bank and email analytics**: connect Plaid through the existing FastAPI app, keep normalized transactions in local SQLite, encrypt access tokens with AES-256-GCM and a Keychain-backed key, and scan authorised mailboxes directly over read-only IMAP for refund opportunities.
- **Provider choices**: DeepSeek, Grok/xAI, OpenAI, Gemini, Moonshot Kimi, Zhipu GLM, Qwen, and OpenRouter are supported through one provider registry.
- **Desktop build**: PyInstaller + pywebview packaging for `Catfolio.app` on macOS.

## Quick Start

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio.git
cd catfolio
docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787). Docker runs in demo mode by default.

### Python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio.git
cd catfolio/v3_backend

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

CATFOLIO_DEMO=1 uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787).

The first visit to Returns or a backtest may take longer while Yahoo Finance history is fetched and cached. Portfolio and Holdings use the current snapshot and stay lightweight.

Keep provider keys out of git. Use `.env`, macOS Keychain, or another local secret store, and prefer separate keys with spending limits where providers support them.

Run without `CATFOLIO_DEMO=1` when you are ready to use real data:

```bash
cd v3_backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --reload
```

On macOS, API keys can also be stored in Keychain under `com.catfolio.portfolio`:

```bash
security add-generic-password -a TRADING212_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
security add-generic-password -a FMP_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
security add-generic-password -a DEEPSEEK_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
```

## Main Screens

- **Portfolio**: a lightweight status view for total value, P&L, breadth, concentration, sector allocation, and major position proportions.
- **Holdings**: the full position ledger, including average cost, current price, total cost, market value, unrealized P&L, account, and an ETF look-through toggle.
- **Returns**: time-weighted return views and benchmark comparisons.
- **Analysis Charts**: monthly return heatmaps, drawdowns, holding correlations, valuation, distributions, and attribution views.
- **Backtest**: predefined multi-asset experiments and optimizer-style workflows.
- **Strategy Lab**: custom Python strategy research with historical rebalancing, saved run history, performance metrics, and optional AI evaluation.
- **Heatmap**: short-term performance grid across the current universe.
- **AI Analyst**: a chat-oriented portfolio assistant with a preset question library for briefing, risk, overlap, what-if, performance, and free-form Q&A.
- **Bank**: local SQLite account and transaction storage, Plaid Link and incremental sync, subscription detection, refund matching, and opt-in direct IMAP analysis. Mail credentials stay in the OS Keychain; raw message bodies are not persisted.
- **Import**: broker CSV upload for users who do not use Trading 212.
- **Settings**: API keys, data refresh controls, demo mode, AI provider selection, Telegram alert configuration, and cache controls.

## Strategy Example

Strategy Lab is designed for turning investment hypotheses into repeatable strategy backtests. A strategy is a Python allocation function that receives historical market context and returns target portfolio weights at each rebalance date:

```python
def strategy(ctx):
    weights = {}

    eligible = [
        ticker
        for ticker in ctx.universe
        if ctx.price(ticker) > ctx.sma(ticker, 200)
    ]

    if not eligible:
        return weights

    for ticker in eligible:
        weights[ticker] = 1.0 / len(eligible)

    return weights
```

Results include equity curve, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, turnover-style diagnostics, saved run history, and optional AI critique. This makes Catfolio useful both as a personal portfolio tracker and as a lightweight quant strategy sandbox.

## Roadmap

- **More broker API integrations**: the next major direction is adding support for more brokerage APIs so Catfolio can sync live holdings beyond the current Trading 212 workflow.
- **UI and UX polish milestone**: if the project reaches 1,000 GitHub stars, a dedicated UI/UX optimization pass will focus on navigation, layout density, responsive behavior, visual consistency, and smoother day-to-day portfolio workflows.

## Data And Privacy

- No analytics or telemetry are built into the app.
- Private runtime outputs are ignored by git, including `.env`, `outputs/`, `build/`, `dist/`, and generated release archives.
- `CATFOLIO_DATA_DIR` lets you keep private data outside the repository.
- Demo mode uses static sample holdings and market content.
- Demo-mode bank and email examples are generated from bundled fictional records. In real mode, Plaid access tokens are encrypted locally and bank transactions remain in the configured `CATFOLIO_DATA_DIR`.
- External network calls happen only when you configure and use providers such as Trading 212, Yahoo Finance, FMP, Finnhub, Massive, FRED, Plaid, IMAP, Telegram, or an AI provider.

This is not financial advice. Catfolio is a personal analysis tool; verify all numbers before making investment decisions.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd v3_backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
cd ..
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest v3_backend/tests
python3 -m compileall -q v3_backend scripts
```

Run the open-source readiness check:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/check_open_source_ready.py
```

Create a sanitized source archive:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/export_open_source_archive.py
```

## macOS Desktop Build

Build `dist/Catfolio.app` from the repository root:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/pyinstaller catfolio.spec --clean
```

The desktop app embeds the FastAPI backend and opens a local pywebview window.
