# Catfolio — Local-first Portfolio, Quant, and Strategy Dashboard

Catfolio is a self-hosted portfolio dashboard and quantitative research workspace for investors who want a private command center for holdings, returns, risk, strategy experiments, and AI-assisted analysis.

It runs locally as a web app, can be packaged as a macOS desktop app, and ships with a full demo mode so contributors can explore the product without a broker account or API keys.

The project combines portfolio accounting with quant-style research tools: factor exposure, benchmark comparison, Monte Carlo simulation, efficient-frontier optimization, historical return modeling, and saved Python strategy backtests.

Project repository: [github.com/irrwood/catfolio](https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio)

## Highlights

- **Local-first by default**: portfolio files, imported CSVs, caches, saved strategy runs, and API keys stay on your machine.
- **Demo-safe for open source**: `CATFOLIO_DEMO=1` uses bundled sample data and does not read local private account files.
- **Broker sync or CSV import**: connect Trading 212 for live holdings, or upload broker transaction CSVs to calculate weighted-average cost and current positions.
- **Portfolio overview**: total value, P&L, breadth, concentration, sector exposure, and the largest positions at a glance.
- **Detailed holdings**: full position detail with cost basis, quote currency, market value, P&L, account, and raw-versus-ETF-look-through views.
- **Returns workspace**: portfolio returns against benchmarks such as SPY, QQQ, and IWM, with monthly heatmaps.
- **Analysis charts**: monthly return heatmaps, drawdown curves, holding correlations, valuation matrices, and return distributions.
- **Strategy Lab**: write Python allocation strategies, rebalance over historical prices, compare CAGR/volatility/Sharpe/max drawdown, save runs, and optionally ask an AI provider to critique the result.
- **Call tracker**: import dated bullish/bearish stock calls from any source and score them 5, 21 and 63 trading days later against SPY, with hit rates per source, a follow-every-call curve and monthly hit rates.
- **AI analysis**: portfolio briefing, risk diagnosis, performance explanation, overlap analysis, what-if scenarios, returns explanation, and free-form portfolio Q&A.
- **Local-first bank and email analytics**: connect Plaid through the existing FastAPI app, keep normalized transactions in local SQLite, encrypt access tokens with AES-256-GCM and a Keychain-backed key, and scan authorised mailboxes directly over read-only IMAP for refund opportunities.
- **Provider choices**: DeepSeek, Grok/xAI, OpenAI, Gemini, Moonshot Kimi, Zhipu GLM, Qwen, and OpenRouter are supported through one provider registry.
- **Desktop build**: PyInstaller + pywebview packaging for `Catfolio.app` on macOS.

Keep provider keys out of git. Use `.env`, macOS Keychain, or another local secret store, and prefer separate keys with spending limits where providers support them.

Run without `CATFOLIO_DEMO=1` when you are ready to use real data:

```bash
cd v3_backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --reload
```

On macOS, API keys can also be stored in Keychain under `com.catfolio.portfolio`:

```bash
security add-generic-password -a TRADING212_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
security add-generic-password -a FMP_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
security add-generic-password -a DEEPSEEK_API_KEY -s com.catfolio.portfolio -w "your_key"
```

## Main Screens

- **Portfolio**: a lightweight status view for total value, P&L, breadth, concentration, sector allocation, and major position proportions.
- **Holdings**: the full position ledger, including average cost, current price, total cost, market value, unrealized P&L, account, and an ETF look-through toggle.
- **Returns**: time-weighted return views and benchmark comparisons.
- **Analysis Charts**: monthly return heatmaps, drawdowns, holding correlations, valuation, distributions, and attribution views.
- **Backtest**: predefined multi-asset experiments and optimizer-style workflows.
- **Strategy Lab**: custom Python strategy research with historical rebalancing, saved run history, performance metrics, and optional AI evaluation.
- **Call tracker**: a cross-source table of hit rates and excess returns for imported stock calls, and a per-source view with a follow-every-call curve, monthly hit rates, and every call with its entry and exit.
- **Heatmap**: short-term performance grid across the current universe.
- **AI Analyst**: a chat-oriented portfolio assistant with a preset question library for briefing, risk, overlap, what-if, performance, and free-form Q&A.
- **Bank**: local SQLite account and transaction storage, Plaid Link and incremental sync, subscription detection, refund matching, and opt-in direct IMAP analysis. Mail credentials stay in the OS Keychain; raw message bodies are not persisted.
- **Import**: broker CSV upload for users who do not use Trading 212.
- **Settings**: API keys, data refresh controls, demo mode, AI provider selection, Telegram alert configuration, and cache controls.

## Strategy Example

Strategy Lab is designed for turning investment hypotheses into repeatable strategy backtests. A strategy is a Python allocation function that receives historical market context and returns target portfolio weights at each rebalance date:

```python
def strategy(ctx):
    weights = {}

    eligible = [
        ticker
        for ticker in ctx.universe
        if ctx.price(ticker) > ctx.sma(ticker, 200)
    ]

    if not eligible:
        return weights

    for ticker in eligible:
        weights[ticker] = 1.0 / len(eligible)

    return weights
```

Results include equity curve, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, turnover-style diagnostics, saved run history, and optional AI critique. This makes Catfolio useful both as a personal portfolio tracker and as a lightweight quant strategy sandbox.

## Call Tracker

The Call tracker (`/calls`) keeps score of dated stock calls from any source: a blogger, a newsletter, an analyst note or your own journal. Import a JSONL file with one call per line, either by uploading it on the page or by entering a local path:

```json
{"date": "2026-09-22", "source": "My journal", "symbol": "NVDA", "stance": "bullish", "reason": "Supply still tight", "url": "https://example.com/note"}
```

- Required fields: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `source` (or `channel`), `symbol` (or `ticker`) and `stance` (`bullish`, `bearish` or `neutral`; the Chinese labels 看多, 看空 and 中性 also work). Optional: `name`, `reason`, and `url` or a YouTube `video_id`. The `calls.jsonl` written by [finfluencer-digest](https://github.com/jackieyangjq/finfluencer-digest) imports as is.
- Only the first call per source, day and ticker is kept, so re-importing a growing file adds just the new lines. Hong Kong codes such as `700.HK` become Yahoo's `0700.HK`, and bare crypto tickers (`BTC`, `ETH`, `SOL`, `DOGE`, `XRP`) become Yahoo's `-USD` pairs, because Yahoo's `BTC` is a bitcoin fund, not bitcoin.
- Scoring: the entry is the first close after the call date and the exit is 5, 21 or 63 trading days later. Bearish calls count the negated return, and excess return is measured against SPY held in the same direction. Calls still inside their window, and calls without prices, stay out of every denominator; sources with fewer than 10 scored calls are marked as too early to judge.
- Prices are Yahoo daily closes from the cache Strategy Lab uses. Calls, prices and results stay in `CATFOLIO_DATA_DIR`. Demo mode shows four fictional sources with generated prices and never fetches data.

The Call tracker is for reviewing past calls, not investment advice.

## Roadmap

- **More broker API integrations**: the next major direction is adding support for more brokerage APIs so Catfolio can sync live holdings beyond the current Trading 212 workflow.
- **UI and UX polish milestone**: if the project reaches 1,000 GitHub stars, a dedicated UI/UX optimization pass will focus on navigation, layout density, responsive behavior, visual consistency, and smoother day-to-day portfolio workflows.

## Data And Privacy

- No analytics or telemetry are built into the app.
- Private runtime outputs are ignored by git, including `.env`, `outputs/`, `build/`, `dist/`, and generated release archives.
- `CATFOLIO_DATA_DIR` lets you keep private data outside the repository.
- Demo mode uses static sample holdings and market content.
- Demo-mode bank and email examples are generated from bundled fictional records. In real mode, Plaid access tokens are encrypted locally and bank transactions remain in the configured `CATFOLIO_DATA_DIR`.
- External network calls happen only when you configure and use providers such as Trading 212, Yahoo Finance, FMP, Finnhub, Massive, FRED, Plaid, IMAP, Telegram, or an AI provider.

This is not financial advice. Catfolio is a personal analysis tool; verify all numbers before making investment decisions.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd v3_backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
cd ..
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest v3_backend/tests
python3 -m compileall -q v3_backend scripts
```

Run the open-source readiness check:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/check_open_source_ready.py
```

Create a sanitized source archive:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/export_open_source_archive.py
```

## macOS Desktop Build

Build `dist/Catfolio.app` from the repository root:

```bash
v3_backend/.venv/bin/pyinstaller catfolio.spec --clean
```

The desktop app embeds the FastAPI backend and opens a local pywebview window.
